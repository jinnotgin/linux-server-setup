# Linux Server Bootstrap (SSH hardening, Docker, Portainer, templates)

`setup.sh` is an interactive bootstrap script for Ubuntu/Debian-like hosts. It focuses on SSH/root hardening, Docker/Portainer installation, daily backups to Google Drive via `rclone`, and optional rendering of ready-made Docker Compose templates (SSL renewal, Nginx reverse proxy, VLESS over WebSocket, and Hysteria2). You can run only the parts you want (e.g., skip hardening/install and just render templates).

## What the script does
- Requests sudo at the start when privileged steps are selected.
- (Optional) Updates packages and sets locale to `en_US.UTF-8` and timezone to `Asia/Singapore`.
- (Optional) Hardens SSH: disables root login and password authentication, forces protocol 2, and restarts `sshd`.
- Prompts for a username to create/ensure sudo access and docker group membership (password is requested when the user is created).
- (Optional) Installs Docker Engine + Compose plugin and deploys Portainer (`portainer/portainer-ce`) on ports `8000` and `9443` using the `portainer_data` volume.
- (Optional) Installs `rclone`, optionally configures a Google Drive remote using a service account JSON, and sets up a daily Portainer backup (local archive + optional Drive upload) with systemd service/timer.
- Optionally renders Docker Compose templates with your inputs (domain/email/UUIDs/TLS paths) into the `generated/` folder, and can start the stacks right after rendering if Docker is present.

## Usage
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
Run as root or a sudo-capable user. The script will prompt for:
- Which sections to run (system prep, hardening, Docker/Portainer, backups, template rendering).
- Sudo password (if needed).
- The username to create/ensure, and a password if the user is being created.
- Optional Google Drive service account JSON path for automated `rclone` configuration.
- Domain names, email, UUIDs, and other template parameters if you choose to render templates.

> Re-login after the script finishes so the chosen user picks up new group memberships (sudo/docker).

## Portainer backup & restore
See [`docs/portainer-backup.md`](docs/portainer-backup.md) for details on how the daily backup works and how to restore from the archives.

## Template overview (`docker-templates/`)
The script can render these into `generated/` with your answers:
- **ssl-renewal**: `certbot` standalone renewal that keeps certificates under `./certs`. Supports multiple domains. Binds port 80 only so it can coexist with Nginx on 443.
- **nginx**: reverse proxy that serves TLS using the certificates from `./certs` and proxies `/ws` to the Xray (VLESS) container over the shared `proxy_net` network.
- **vless-ws**: `teddysun/xray` serving VLESS over WebSocket without terminating TLS (Nginx does TLS on 443 and forwards to this service on port 10000 inside `proxy_net`). Supports multiple UUID clients.
- **hysteria2**: Hysteria2 server using the same TLS files, supports multiple users, and masquerades to a configurable site (defaults to Hacker News).

After rendering, you can let the script start the generated stacks automatically (if Docker is installed), or start them yourself with `docker compose up -d` from each generated directory.

## Notes
- SSH hardening disables password logins. Ensure you have SSH keys configured before running the script remotely.
- The script backs up `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` before applying changes.
- The Certbot template binds port 80; the Nginx template binds 443. They can co-exist without port conflicts, but ensure port 80 is free when running Certbot.
- Nginx terminates TLS using the certificates generated by Certbot; the VLESS/Xray service stays behind Nginx on `proxy_net` (no direct TLS on the Xray container).
- Before starting the Nginx or VLESS stacks, create the shared Docker network with `docker network create proxy_net` (the script will also create it automatically if Docker is available when you choose to auto-start stacks).
- Update the `obfs` password in the Hysteria2 config after generation if you want a custom value.

## Nginx content seeding
When rendering templates, the script can optionally download a static 2048 game (from `jinnotgin/2048`) into `generated/nginx/www`. The Nginx config serves `/usr/share/nginx/html` by default, so that content becomes the site at your domain root. If you skip the download, a simple placeholder page is written to `generated/nginx/www/index.html`; replace it with your own site files at any time.
